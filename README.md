Problem 2 (Reversing String - **)

**Analysis:**

- had a very good use of the slicing
- input from another student helped me think intuitively and  map out the question, this is seen in the comment

computational thinking: processes involved in formulating a problem and expressing the solutions in such way a computer(human or machine) can effectively carry it out

1. **decomposition: base cases**
    - if you get to the last letter of the word,return the letter
    - if you slice the whole word, return nothing
2. **pattern recognition:** similarities among problems and data
    - repeatedly slice the next first letter of a word off and return the rest of the word into the function
3. **abstraction:** more general representation
    - necessary components/possible variables
        - user input
4. **algorithm development:** produce unambiguous instructions (note: press the arrows to see all steps)
    - keep slicing the word, isolating the first character each time
    - if the sliced word is not one character
        - keep slicing the first letter off
    - and if nothing is entered
        - return nothing
    - keep passing the sliced word into the the function
    - when the last letter gets passed up, it will keep adding the letter+ the previous first letter from the call stack

Problem 5 (Factorials and Caching - **)

**Analysis:**

- recently I read about "memoization" and how it is a dynamic programming approach. Seeing that recursive problems often have runtimes of O(branches^depth), this can look like  O(8^n) which we have learned is one of the worst runtimes. This question perfectly demonstrates how efficient caching with dictionaries can be, it reduces the runtime from O(2^n) to O(1) if the factorial has already been calculated previously

computational thinking: processes involved in formulating a problem and expressing the solutions in such way a computer(human or machine) can effectively carry it out

1. **decomposition**
    - what/where am I going to cache
    - how do I get the factorial of a number?

1. **pattern recognition:** similarities among problems and data
    - using dictionaries
2. **abstraction:** more general representation
    - necessary components/possible variables
        - factorial
        - dictionary of queue
3. **algorithm development:** produce unambiguous instructions (note: press the arrows to see all steps)
    - if the number is in the queue, return the corresponding factorial of the number

    - if the number is not 0
        - keep following the pattern of number x number!
    - assuming all positive entries, we return 1 if the input is 0

Problem 4 (Course Grade Analysis - ***)

**Analysis:**

- This problem was a big learning problem to understand how to use information from a file. The way we read in the file was pretty much identical from one another.
- Problems I had at first was understanding how it would get the highest/lowest mark's name and how I understood it was it would read in all the information for each student and compare every aspect(ex. highest grade) each time and the variables would be updated so my thinking of searching a document like how humans do, I had friends help me understand it like a computer

computational thinking: processes involved in formulating a problem and expressing the solutions in such way a computer(human or machine) can effectively carry it out

1. **decomposition**
    - read in file
    - number of people who passed/failed
    - highest/lowest grade
    - highest/lowest name
    - final grade
2. **pattern recognition:** similarities among problems and data
    - studentinfo files haves the pattern of:
    - finding highest and lowest grades : can be found using similar steps
    - finding highest and lowest names: can be found using similar steps
3. **abstraction:** more general representation
    - necessary components/possible variables
        - passed/failed
        - highest/lowest grade
        - highest/lowest name
        - number of students and sum â€”> average
        - read in information about all students, manipulate those values to solve
4. **algorithm development:** produce unambiguous instructions (note: press the arrows to see all steps)
    - ask user to enter a file name
    - read in the file
    - while the next line isn't empty
    - print out summary of grades
    - close the file
